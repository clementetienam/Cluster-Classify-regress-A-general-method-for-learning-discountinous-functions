Cluster, classify, regress: a general method for learning discontinuous functions

This paper presents a method for solving the supervised learning problem in which the output is highly nonlinear and discontinuous. It is proposed to solve this problem in three stages: (i) cluster the pairs of input-output data points, resulting
in a label for each point; (ii) classify the data, where the corresponding label is the output; and finally (iii) perform one separate regression for each class,
where the training data corresponds to the subset of the original input-output pairs which have that label according to the classifier. It has not yet been proposed to
combine these 3 fundamental building blocks of machine learning in this simple and powerful fashion. This can be viewed as a form of deep learning, where any
of the intermediate layers can itself be deep. The utility and robustness of the methodology is illustrated on some toy problems.
